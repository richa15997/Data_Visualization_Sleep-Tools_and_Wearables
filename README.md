# Data_Visualization_Sleep_Tools_and_Wearables

This project involves visualising real Actigraphy Data of children, helping to improve a child’s health in day to day life using features like BMI, activity exertion plotted with continuous time. The live data plots would help predict the reason of a child’s poor health from previous database, and also help to predict sleep performance of a child that night.

Expanding its features using day-to-day calorie consumption of junk-food, mental stress etc. could have also been used to increase accuracy of Visualisation. 

# Datasets

Real Actigraphy data was collected using actigraphy sensors on children in weight-reducing camps. Queries were fired and fetched using Postgree and then the real data was visualised. 

Visualization involves comparison of bmi and activity levels of indivdials and groups. The individuals are BC_43 and BC_45. 

BC and LC are datasets of groups of individuals. 

Data for all individuals and groups is given wrt to their bmi and their activity exertion during weekdays and weekends. Their activity exertion varies between light, moderate and vigorous.
# Requirements

Javascript was used to code the back-end of the dashboard. The bootstrap templates were used to give it a good visual appearance. 
NVd3 library of Javascript was used to enhance the performance of the back-end.  

# Analysis

Data plotted is visualized by displaying the comparison of bmi,activity of child during weekdays as compared to weekdays. It can be seen that data visualized during week-days and week-ends. Children tend to start doing more vigorous activity during weekdays earlier towards 8 pm whereas during weekends they would perform it later in the day.

When you visualize the data you can easily see that BC_43 is more lethargic than BC_45, also convinving as BC_43 is a girl whereas BC_45 is a boy. 

Analysis, can also be made by comparing groups and individuals.
